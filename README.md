# Knowledge Club

## Who are we?

Welcome to the Knowledge Club! 

Our goal is to create the largest condensated knowledge repository or, in other words, a place where you can find everything you need for whatever reason you need it for, think of it as a wikipedia of programming.

This organization is not proprietary. We have moderators and organizers to help keep things in order, but this is open for everybody who wants to share knowledge in a free way.

## How does it work?

We divided the organization into series of repos. Each repo represents a programing language, tecnology, pattern, architecture and/or concept, for example:

> A new topic about Flux will have a new repo called `Flux`

And so on...

This repo is intended to deal with internal matters, such as: Standards, suggestions, quotes, doubts, questions, complains and __everything related to the organization itself *OR* all of the repositories contained here__.

For topic-specific questions open an issue ou PR directly into the repository in question.

## How can I help?

It is simple, first of all, read the [CONTRIBUTING session](CONTRIBUTING.md), it will guide you through the first steps.

Once you have read the contributing session, open an __issue__ here on this repository entitled `[New Topic] <topic name>` and describe what you intend to do/write about that topic in the description.

Your topic will be reviewed by one of our moderators and will be created, then you will be added to the repository owners and will have full access to your "Knowledge Room".

> But remember: This is an open project, which means all repositories must have adhere to new contributions/contributors

## Is there any rules

Not much, just the basics:

- When a repo is created with a topic the main structure containing your README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING files will be ready, please __do not__ remove any of this files
- The folder organization is standard throughout all the repos. The `contents` folder will have several subfolders indicating the language of the files it contains, please __do not__ change this order
- Please __do not__ change the license type
- We follow the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) code of conduct, all members __must__ adhere to this document

That's it! Happy learning!
